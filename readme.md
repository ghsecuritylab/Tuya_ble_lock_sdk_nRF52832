# 1 Overview
&emsp;&emsp;The Tuya common Bluetooth door lock is a common version of Tuya Bluetooth door locks.
The Tuya common Bluetooth door lock SDK allows you to connect your lock business app to the TuyaSmart app and Tuya Smart platform through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

&emsp;&emsp;Tuya provides this document to help you resolve all issues during embedded software development. If you encounter a problem, read this document first.

&emsp;&emsp;<font color=#FF0000>To get quickly started</font>, see section 5.2 "Example." This section describes serial interface commands for hardware simulation and a quick experience of Tuya lock products. You may also use the example for subsequent debugging.

# 2 Software Architecture
&emsp;&emsp;Tuya BLE products use the common, basic Bluetooth network pairing protocol, which implements the common Bluetooth product network pairing process and basic data communications. For details about the protocol, see *Tuya Common BLE SDK Protocol*. The source code is stored in the **tuya_ble_sdk** folder. If you use the demo platform, ignore this protocol because Tuya has migrated the protocol. If you use a new platform, migrate this protocol. For details, see *Tuya Common BLE SDK Development Guide*.

&emsp;&emsp;In addition to the common network pairing protocol, Tuya defines a set of data point (DP) protocols for lock products. These protocols describe the communications logic between lock business and a mobile app. To facilitate development, Tuya has encapsulated these DP protocols. For details about the source code, see the app-layer files **lock_dp_parser** and **lock_dp_report**. For details about the protocol content, see *Tuya BLE Lock DP Specifications*.

&emsp;&emsp;The preceding Tuya Bluetooth product network pairing, communications, and lock service implementation are the main framework. In addition to the main framework, there are some important support components: third-party components and Tuya components. Third-party components implement common features such as storage and debugging, whereas Tuya components implement private features such as authorization and product test.

&emsp;&emsp;Third-party components include easyFlash, easyLogger, and mbedtls. If you use the demo platform, ignore these components because Tuya has migrated them. If you use a new platform, simply migrate the easyFlash and easyLogger components and do not alter the mbedtls component. The mbedtls component mainly contains encryption APIs.

&emsp;&emsp;Tuya components are common source code packages and apply to most Tuya's low-power single-node BLE products. This document describes their application in door lock apps and provides reference for applications in other apps. Tuya components include the components of authorization product test, Over-the-Air (OTA) upgrades, local storage management, and complete device tests. The authorization product test component is used for burning and verification of parameters such as the MAC address, authkey, and device ID that the common network pairing protocol requires.
For details, see *Tuya Common BLE Authorization Product Test Protocol*. The OTA upgrade component implements the Tuya-defined Bluetooth OTA protocol. If you use a non-demo platform, migrate this component. For details, see *Tuya Common BLE SDK Protocol*. The local storage management component implements the local storage logic of lock apps and also applies to other apps. The complete device test component tests overall product functions. For details, see *Tuya Common BLE Complete Device Test Protocol*.

&emsp;&emsp;In addition to the main framework and support components, an isolation layer called "app_port" is deployed between the app layer and other layers to improve compatibility of the app layer (involving Tuya components). At the app layer, you can only view bottom-layer APIs (their names start with "app_port") that have been encapsulated at the isolation layer and app layer APIs.

# 3 Important Parsing
## 3.1 Local Storage Management
&emsp;&emsp;**tuya_ble_sdk** requires 16 KB flash memory to store system information related to authorization and **tuya_ble_sdk**. The flash memory must be separately allocated and cannot be used for other purposes. The memory start address is TUYA_NV_START_ADDR.

&emsp;&emsp;By default, the app layer requires 16 KB flash memory to store offline records and other app data (key-value storage structure based on easyFlash). You can use the remaining space and need to adjust the occupied flash memory size based on actual usage. The memory start address is EF_START_ADDR, and the occupied memory size is ENV_AREA_SIZE. Related APIs are as follows:
  - uint32_t app_port_kv_set(const char *key, const void *buf, size_t size);
  - uint32_t app_port_kv_get(const char *key, void *buf, size_t size);
  - uint32_t app_port_kv_del(const char *key);

&emsp;&emsp;The above mentioned flash memory contains only the user data storage area and does not contain the code storage area.

&emsp;&emsp;Local storage includes hardware, event, and settings storage. The storage logic is implemented in the **app_flash.c** file.

### 3.1.1 Hardware Storage
&emsp;&emsp;The app layer has implemented the management logic for hardware storage and can store up to 256 hardware devices. A hardware device support one type of door opening methods, and the app layer can store four door opening method types. You can adjust the maximum number of stored door opening methods of each type based on actual requirements. By default, each type supports 10 door opening methods, as shown in the following figure.

![image.png](http://note.youdao.com/yws/res/674/WEBRESOURCE2c28a9f127ec44085cf5a7d441121ea3)

### 3.1.2 Event Storage
&emsp;&emsp;The app layer has implemented the management logic for event storage and can store "EVTID_MAX" events. You can adjust the maximum number of events that can be stored based on actual requirements. If the size of stored event data exceeds the allocated flash memory size, the flash memory needs to be re-allocated. By default, up to 64 events can be stored, as shown in the following figure.

![image.png](http://note.youdao.com/yws/res/676/WEBRESOURCE77d2a594c1c186af4dbafd4119f44094)

### 3.1.3 Settings Storage
&emsp;&emsp;The app layer has implemented the management logic for settings storage to store setting items related to the door lock. For details, see the "lock_settings_t" structure.

&emsp;&emsp;To modify a default door lock setting, modify the related parameter in "lock_settings_default" of the API.

## 3.2 Bluetooth Data Channel
![image.png](http://note.youdao.com/yws/res/679/WEBRESOURCEd61b09e64d3d68b156a08fadbdc56f99)

## 3.3 DP Parsing
&emsp;&emsp;The **lock_dp_parser** and **lock_dp_report** files are used for DP parsing based on *Tuya BLE Lock DP Specifications*. These files describe this protocol specification document in C language.

&emsp;&emsp;The **lock_dp_parser.c** file is used for parsing lock DP data received through Bluetooth. If the parsed data is related to hardware, the data will be sent to the **lock_hard.c** file, which contains the API for DP data and local logic and deserves your most attention.

&emsp;&emsp;The **lock_dp_report.c** file is used for reporting DP data through Bluetooth. To report required data in the local logic, invoke the encapsulated API in this file.

## 3.4 OTA Upgrade
&emsp;&emsp;The OTA upgrade component is stored in the **app_ota** file. The demo implementation process applies to the demo platform. It is only for your reference if you use a new platform. To perform an OTA upgrade of the new platform, use the communications protocol that Tuya provides. To put it simply, Tuya provides the Tuya Smart platform to store OTA upgrade files and data communications protocols. You need to implement the local flash storage logic for the OTA upgrade component. The logic has been implemented in the demo project.

## 3.5 Product Test
&emsp;&emsp;Product tests of a Tuya Bluetooth lock product include the following:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1. Authorization test: inspects product information and burns the MAC address, device ID (or UUID), and authkey.
	
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2. Complete device test: includes the mandatory RF received signal strength indicator (RSSI) test and optional tests of other functions.
	
&emsp;&emsp;The purpose of an authorization product test is authorization. It involves inspection of product information and burning of important parameters used in the common network pairing protocol, including the MAC address, device ID (or UUID), and authkey. It is the base for product security. The complete device test tests product peripherals to ensure a low defect rate during production. Tuya has provided a complete Bluetooth-based product test protocol, product test Dongle firmware, and product test microcontroller unit (MCU) for complete device tests. For details about the product test, see related protocol documents.
